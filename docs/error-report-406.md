4. **API Configuration Check**
   - Reviewed Supabase client initialization
   - Confirmed API endpoint configuration

### Potential Root Causes

1. **Content Negotiation Mismatch**
   - Server might not support the requested content type
   - Possible misconfiguration in API response formats

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Token permissions might not match required scopes
   - Possible role-based access control conflicts

3. **Client Configuration**
   - Supabase client might need updated configuration
   - Possible version compatibility issues

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Review server-side content type configurations
2. Verify API endpoint response format settings
3. Check authentication token permissions and scopes
4. Update Supabase client configuration if needed
5. Implement additional request logging for debugging

### Impact

This error prevents users from accessing their profile data after authentication, affecting the following functionality:
- User profile loading
- Authorization checks
- User-specific content display

### Additional Notes

The error appears to be specifically related to content negotiation between the client and server, suggesting a mismatch in the expected response format or incorrect header configuration. Further investigation of the server-side API configuration and client-side request formatting is recommended.
